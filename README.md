ðŸ“˜ Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) journey in Java! ðŸš€

This repository contains all the code Iâ€™ve written while learning and practicing DSA using the Java programming language. The goal of this project is to document my progress, build a strong foundation in problem-solving, and create a useful reference for myself and others who are also learning DSA.

ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?
You'll find Java implementations of:

Core data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more

Popular algorithms including Searching, Sorting, Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, etc.

Problem-solving techniques used in platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces

Well-commented code and occasional explanations for clarity

ðŸ’¡ Why This Repository?
This repository serves as:

A learning log to track my understanding and growth

A resource for others who are beginning their DSA journey in Java

A portfolio to showcase my coding style and problem-solving skills

ðŸ“Œ Note
All the code in this repository is written as part of my learning process. It may not always represent the most optimal solution, but it reflects my effort to understand the concepts thoroughly.
